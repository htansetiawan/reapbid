# ReapBid

In a standard (one-shot) Bertrand competition, firms with the same cost structure race to the bottom by setting prices equal to marginal cost, p=c. However, when competition is repeated over many rounds (or infinitely), the outcome can shift. Firms can potentially sustain higher prices (tacit collusion) by threatening to punish those who undercut.

ReapBit demonstrates this dynamic by running simulations of repeated interactions under various assumptions (discount factors, number of players, strategies, punishment rules, etc.). Itâ€™s designed for researchers, students, and anyone curious about game-theoretic models of competition.
