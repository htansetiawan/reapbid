# ReapBid: The Repeated Bertrand Competition Simulator

ReapBid is an innovative simulation platform designed to explore the dynamics of **repeated Bertrand competition**. It provides a hands-on tool for understanding how market behaviors evolve when competition extends over many rounds, moving beyond the standard race-to-the-bottom pricing.

### Why ReapBid?

In traditional one-shot Bertrand competition, firms often undercut each other, driving prices down to marginal cost. But when competition repeats, a whole new world of strategies emerges—**tacit collusion**, punishment mechanisms, and cooperative equilibria become possible. ReapBid empowers users to explore these fascinating dynamics with:

- **Customizable Simulations:** Configure variables like discount factors, number of players, strategies, and punishment rules.
- **Game-Theoretic Insights:** Visualize how firms adapt strategies to maximize profits over repeated interactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for researchers, educators, and anyone curious about economic and behavioral strategies.

### Features

- Simulate repeated interactions between firms under various market conditions.
- Customize the number of firms, cost structures, and punishment strategies.
- Explore the impact of long-term strategies and cooperation incentives.
- Analyze results with built-in graphs and metrics.
